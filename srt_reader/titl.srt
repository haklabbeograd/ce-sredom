2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:06,425
Rumplestiltskin,

3
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:09,618
scared of ending up
just like his coward father.

4
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:12,354
Papa! No!

5
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:14,957
A young boy will lead you to your son.

6
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:16,124
What's going on?

7
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:18,659
The boy will be your undoing.

8
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:21,529
Once you drink this water,
you can never leave Neverland.

9
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,099
It's a small price
to pay for what I get in return.

10
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:25,300
What do you need him to believe in?

11
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,002
Me.

12
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:29,137
Inside is where our salvation awaits.

13
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:31,906
Are you up to the task?

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,809
Follow the lady, gents.

15
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,212
A shilling returns two.

16
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:54,761
What?

17
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:56,230
Don't feel too bad.

18
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,364
You're not the only one

19
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,866
who's been spurned by the lady tonight.

20
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,868
She's been quite shy all evening.

21
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:05,305
You tricked me.

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,173
How'd she get in there?

23
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:14,915
Please, don't hurt him! He's my father!

24
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,316
You'd be better off without him.

25
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:19,886
Uhh!

26
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:24,357
No, no.

27
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:29,628
Are you okay?

28
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,231
The cost of the game.

29
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,767
He didn't even leave me
a shilling for a pint.

30
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,834
How rude.

31
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,870
He took all of our money.

32
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:39,972
Yes, but I'll figure something out.

33
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:42,441
I always do...

34
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:43,943
Rumple.

35
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:48,981
Roll up!

00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:54,015

38
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:06,298
How is she?

39
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:09,501
I fear she's getting worse, Henry.

40
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:10,902
But if I save magic...

41
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,537
She'll live?

42
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:13,638
Yes.

43
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:15,106
But more than that, Henry.

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,642
If you save magic, you'll save us all.

45
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,344
But to do it, you have to truly believe.

46
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:26,117
I do.

47
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:29,553
Good, because we don't have much time.

48
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:30,754
Follow me.

49
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:37,694
My brothers!

50
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:41,432
Tonight, the dream of Neverland
will awaken from its slumber.

51
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:44,502
Tonight, the heart of
the truest believer

52
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,469
shall fulfill its destiny,

53
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:49,205
and with it <i>our</i> destiny.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,810
Tonight, Henry saves magic!

55
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,885
You know, despite our differences,

56
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,588
I can always count on you
to get things done...

57
00:03:05,623 --> 00:03:08,224
Unlike the rest of them.

58
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:11,060
You were right.
They're just a liability.

59
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:13,363
Where are they?

60
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,532
Oh, well, Pan told them Neal was alive,

61
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,267
and, of course, Emma took the bait.

62
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:18,968
Such a waste of time.

63
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:21,236
Oh, I'm so sorry.

64
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:22,431
No, no, don't be. He <i>is</i> alive.

65
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:23,673
What?

66
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:27,342
Pan wasn't lying.
My son is here on the island.

67
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:28,610
I've seen him.

68
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:31,213
You saw him and you...
you just parted ways?

69
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,884
You realize that he might
have a way off the island.

70
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:37,352
Let's worry about the travel plans

71
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:38,453
<i>after</i> we get Henry.

72
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:39,854
There's something you're not telling me.

73
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,423
What happened when you saw him?

74
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:44,859
Look, all you have to know is,
the next time I see him

75
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:47,563
will be when I'm putting Henry
in his arms.

76
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:49,764
When father and son are reunited.

77
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,738
Where are we?

78
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:08,749
These nice ladies are going
to look after you

79
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,117
for a little while.

80
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,885
- You must be the boy...
- Rumplestiltskin.

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Do you know how to spin?

82
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,222
We can teach you.

83
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,725
I... I don't want to stay here.
Please, I... I'll be good.

84
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,893
This will give me time
to get a real job,

85
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,495
so we can be together.

86
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,030
We can be together right now.

87
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,132
Papa, please.

88
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,034
Don't leave me here.

89
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,036
Don't be scared now.

90
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,406
Hey, I got you a present.

91
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,942
A friend.

92
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:37,410
Someone to be at your side
when I'm away.

93
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,412
It will be with you when I cannot.

94
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,348
It will?

95
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,782
Give it a name.

96
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,618
Names always make things better.

97
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,419
They make them real.

98
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,655
Trust me.

99
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,523
It will protect you.

100
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:54,261
And I'll be back before you know it.

101
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,463
I promise.

102
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,212
I'm gonna ask Tink how close
we are to Pan's compound.

103
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,281
I don't wanna be surprised
by any lost boys on patrol.

104
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,482
Good idea.

105
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,686
Looks like you two buried the hatchet.

106
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,490
Buried? Uh... I don't know.

107
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,058
We've at least put it away for now.

108
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,696
So you're really gonna
stay here with him?

109
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,698
The thought of leaving you,
Emma, it kills me.

110
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,733
But there's nothing we can do.

111
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,035
If David leaves the island, he'll die.

112
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,203
So you're just giving up?

113
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,939
Family means being together, all of us.

114
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,740
But there's no other way.

115
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,342
Maybe this is just you
rubbing off on me,

116
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,344
but I don't believe that.

117
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,446
There's always a way.

118
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,790
Well, if this is your
version of a rescue party,

119
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,157
we got here just in time.

120
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,892
What are you two doing here?

121
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:02,893
Well, same as you,

122
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:05,495
except we actually have a chance.

123
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,031
Pandora's box.

124
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:11,268
It could trap Pan for eternity
simply by opening the lid.

125
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,637
You didn't tell me my father was with her.

126
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,638
I didn't know.

127
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:16,340
Wait, your father is the Dark One?

128
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:18,375
Yeah, and he's not getting
anywhere near Henry.

129
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:19,409
Bae...

130
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,177
Why? What are you talking about?

131
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:23,613
There's a prophecy that says
that Henry will be his undoing.

132
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:24,781
He didn't come here to protect him.

133
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,750
He came here to kill him.

134
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:29,653
That's why you didn't want to find Neal

135
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:32,255
before you got Henry back?

136
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,624
Because you knew he'd spill your secret.

137
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,193
Everything I did was to protect Henry,

138
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,794
to rescue him from Pan.

139
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:41,831
It all makes sense.

140
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:44,700
You left before we even made shore.

141
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,935
You wanted to get to Henry first...

142
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,170
To be on his own...

143
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:50,173
So no one could stop you...

144
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:51,241
So you can kill him.

145
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:53,809
It's not gonna happen,

146
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:57,312
not unless you go through
all of us first.

147
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,340
Someone so young...

148
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,475
In such a short time.

149
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:14,577
Look at him.

150
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:15,744
He could spin for...

151
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,613
for kings and queens one day.

152
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,615
I didn't think I had any talent.

153
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,951
Oof, more than talent. A gift!

154
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,852
You could apprentice
with anyone in the land.

155
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:28,190
If I can make money,

156
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:31,259
then my father and I can be together.

157
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:33,962
Rumple...

158
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,363
even with your talent,

159
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,632
too many people know
your father is a cheat.

160
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,234
And a coward.

161
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:41,235
If you are to have a happy life,

162
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,304
you must go somewhere where
your father's name

163
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,472
cannot follow you.

164
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,208
You mean...

165
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:48,309
alone?

166
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,511
This bean...

167
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:53,014
can open a portal,

168
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:54,682
take you far away from this land.

169
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:55,683
Even this realm.

170
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:58,719
You could start a new life.

171
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:00,621
But it cannot be with your father.

172
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:04,091
But he's coming back for me
as soon as he gets a job.

173
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:06,026
The truth is, he's at the pub.

174
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,294
He doesn't want a job.

175
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,263
Or real responsibility.

176
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:13,601
Family can be a strength,
but it can also be a burden.

177
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:18,005
And your father will always
be your burden, Rumplestiltskin.

178
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:22,408
You're making a mistake.

179
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:26,046
I don't care if the boy
is destined to be my undoing.

180
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,048
I won't hurt him.

181
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:30,283
Because that sounds just like you.

182
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:32,485
Without me, you <i>will</i> fail.

183
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,654
I'm the most powerful amongst us.

184
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,189
That's why we can't trust you.

185
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:38,591
If I could give you my dagger,
I would. But I can't.

186
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,760
But you <i>can</i> give me Pandora's box.

187
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:43,329
I don't have to trust you
if I could stop you.

188
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,266
Son...

189
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,308
Look at me,

190
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:58,510
you so much as lift a finger
to perform magic,

191
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:00,546
you're gonna spend an eternity
in this box.

192
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,249
Let's go.

193
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:12,257
Look...

194
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:15,527
you may think you know
who you're up against,

195
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:16,662
but you don't.

196
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:18,597
Then tell me.

197
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:22,200
What really happened between you two?

198
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:27,972
Peter Pan destroyed my father.

199
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:44,054
They were right.

200
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,923
You're here.

201
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:47,358
Hey, laddie.

202
00:09:47,392 --> 00:09:49,260
My dogs were barking after hitting

203
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:51,362
the cobblestones all morning
looking for work.

204
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:53,097
Then these fellas told me
that they never played

205
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:54,231
"find the lady."

206
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:01,371
Rumple.

207
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:02,706
Come on.

208
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:05,109
Rumple!

209
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:10,714
You said you were finding a job!

210
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,315
No one in this town would hire me.

211
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,983
Because no one trusts you.

212
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:17,487
But you do. Don't you, son?

213
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,324
I want to.

214
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:27,429
What if there was someplace
we could start over?

215
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:30,032
Somewhere where no one knew you?

216
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:31,234
How?

217
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,405
With this.

218
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:39,909
Where'd you get that?

219
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:44,946
Do you know how much money
a bean like that would fetch?

220
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:46,248
No, it's mine!

221
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,983
I won't let you gamble it away.

222
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,251
Rumple, you don't understand.

223
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,920
I understand this bean
can take us someplace...

224
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:55,223
where no one knows us.

225
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:56,759
Where we can be a family.

226
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:00,428
A real fresh start.

227
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:01,763
Yes.

228
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:07,368
I trust you.

229
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:11,506
Then where should we go? Hmm?

230
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,676
There must be someplace special to you.

231
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,076
Oh.

232
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:17,845
Think, think.

233
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,047
Think, think, think, think, think.

234
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:25,453
Think lovely thoughts.

235
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:27,355
That's it.

236
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,356
What?

237
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,057
When I was a boy,

238
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:32,092
my father sold me to a blacksmith.

239
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:35,262
All day in front of hot coals,
the sweat and the grime.

240
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:37,431
But every night I would say to myself,

241
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:40,201
"think lovely thoughts."

242
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:43,304
And in my sleep, I would travel
to the most wonderful place.

243
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:44,872
What was it called?

244
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:48,942
Neverland.

245
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:52,312
Then that's where we should go.

246
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:07,727
I don't even know if this place is real.

247
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,234
We need to talk.

248
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:32,535
I've found when a woman says that,

249
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:35,004
I'm rarely in for pleasant conversation.

250
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,473
There has to be a way
for David to leave the island.

251
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,242
Well, there isn't.

252
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:40,910
He told me about your brother,
what happened.

253
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,665
I know it can't be easy
to talk about, but...

254
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,980
Well, then let's not, shall we?

255
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,654
The water that cured David
from dreamshade

256
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,816
has connected him to the island.

257
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,518
If he leaves, the connection is broken.

258
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,019
The poison <i>will</i> kill him.

259
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,387
What if we take some
of the water with us?

260
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:53,622
That way he stays connected.

261
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:54,757
He can stay alive in Storybrooke.

262
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,258
For how long?

263
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,493
Once the water runs out,

264
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,562
the dreamshade <i>will take his life.</i>

265
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:02,030
Unless there was another cure.

266
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:05,633
You suddenly interested
in what I have to say?

267
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:08,270
Thought I wasn't to be trusted.

268
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:11,239
You're not, but I'll take my chances.

269
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:12,441
Well, if you remember,

270
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,476
I, too, was poisoned with dreamshade

271
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,711
by a cowardly pirate.

272
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:17,812
And yet...

273
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:19,914
Yes, and we know
how you cured yourself...

274
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,716
with a candle that takes
another person's life.

275
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,050
David is not that selfish.

276
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,285
Oh, how noble.

277
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:27,922
The point is,
after my near-death experience,

278
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:30,458
I discovered much about the poison.

279
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,126
I believe I could create an elixir

280
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,497
back in my shop.

281
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,399
Well, this <i>is</i> quite the favor.

282
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:42,103
I'd expect one of equal weight
in return.

283
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:45,272
No.

284
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:46,673
When we get back to Storybrooke,

285
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,143
you're gonna save David because
it's the right thing to do.

286
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:53,647
No deals, no favors, understand?

287
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,816
Fine.

288
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,385
I'll do as you ask.

289
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,521
I'll go tell David.

290
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:10,230
We're here. Pan's perimeter.

291
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:11,831
It's time.

292
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:13,199
Tink will sneak us
in the back like we planned.

293
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:16,236
We grab Henry. In and out, simple.

294
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,803
You good with Pan patrol?

295
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:20,040
Locked and loaded.

296
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:22,208
You mind if I, uh...

297
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:23,410
borrow this?

298
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:25,512
You said no magic, I agreed.

299
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:28,447
But I'm not walking in there
with nothing but my good looks.

300
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,082
Now I, on the other hand...

301
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,283
Here, in case your good looks fail you.

302
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,885
Thanks, mate.

303
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,189
Let's get Henry.

304
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:49,601
Can I at least use magic on these boys?

305
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:50,802
No.

306
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,305
I'll do it.

307
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,840
You remember the spell?

308
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,257
Where's Pan?

309
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,760
I don't know.

310
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:16,827
Henry!

311
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:17,828
He's gotta be somewhere.

312
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,630
Where?

313
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:21,499
Help!

314
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,076
You're an... an adult.

315
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,945
My name's Emma. I'm looking for my son.

316
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:40,951
- Wendy?
- Do I know you?

317
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:42,419
It's Baelfire.

318
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:43,887
- You two know each other?
- Bae!

319
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:45,756
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

320
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,957
Can it really be you?

321
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:54,498
I thought I'd never see you again.

322
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:56,500
What are you...
wh... what are you doing here?

323
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:58,835
Well, I... I came back to save you.

324
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:01,338
You did that for me?

325
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:04,508
Well, I couldn't bear for you
to be without a family,

326
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,208
not after you told us that
your mother and father

327
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,644
were both dead.

328
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:09,278
You told her I was dead?

329
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,280
It was easier than telling the truth...

330
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:12,481
my own father abandoned me.

331
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,531
We actually did it.

332
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:32,401
We made it!

333
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,739
It's just as I remember in my dreams.

334
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:40,542
Hasn't changed at all.

335
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,044
It's beautiful.

336
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,413
No, it's more than that.
Neverland is special.

337
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:46,447
You can do anything here.

338
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:48,449
Just think it, and it can happen.

339
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:51,452
What would you like to eat?

340
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:52,788
Go on.

341
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:57,058
Just think it.

342
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:05,567
You can eat cake all day
and not get a stomachache.

343
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:08,135
Or swing on a vine through a waterfall.

344
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,470
But best of all...

345
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:12,773
you can fly.

346
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:14,909
Flying is impossible.

347
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:17,044
Neverland is where
the impossible <i>is</i> possible,

348
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,445
if you believe it.

349
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,514
Here, I'll show you.

350
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,852
Hoo-whoo!

351
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,388
Whoo!

352
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,756
Uhh.

353
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,696
I don't understand.

354
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,869
I could always fly
when I visited as a boy.

355
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,238
Maybe you can't fly

356
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,039
because you're not a boy anymore.

357
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:49,508
How could I have forgotten?

358
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,644
Of course.

359
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:54,814
Pixie dust.

360
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,316
Even as a boy, you needed pixie dust

361
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:59,352
if you wanted to fly.

362
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:01,787
Where do we get some?

363
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:04,790
Oh, I'll show you.

364
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,565
Come on. Yeah.

365
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:24,143
Hey, Wendy,

366
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:27,880
since you've been here,
have you seen my son?

367
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:28,981
His name's Henry.

368
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:31,984
- You have a son?
- Yeah.

369
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,351
Pan needs his heart.

370
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:34,826
Has he said anything about the heart

371
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:36,321
of the truest believer?

372
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:38,156
No.

373
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,325
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,527
He never mentioned anything
about a heart.

375
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:45,397
She's lying.

376
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:46,998
- Where is he?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

377
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:48,166
What the hell are you doing?

378
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,934
I've carried enough lies in my life

379
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,402
to recognize their burden.

380
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:54,806
She knows where Henry is.

381
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,874
Is that true?

382
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:00,144
You don't understand.

383
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,879
You're helping Pan?

384
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:04,348
He's keeping John and Michael alive,

385
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:05,616
only if I do as he says.

386
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,051
Trust me,

387
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,553
whatever he's promised,
he will go back on his word.

388
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:12,222
And why should I trust a man
who abandoned his own son?

389
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:15,158
Because your brothers did.

390
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:16,927
They trusted a woman named Belle.

391
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:21,398
They helped her get this box
so we can defeat Pan.

392
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,099
They're okay?

393
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,600
For now,

394
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,536
and only if we succeed.

395
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,737
Wendy...

396
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:32,608
we will save John and Michael,
I swear to God.

397
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:36,512
But right now, I really need your help.

398
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:37,914
Please.

399
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:43,419
Pan told Henry that...

400
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:47,122
he needs his heart to save magic.

401
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:49,759
But it's a lie.

402
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:51,828
He needs it to save himself.

403
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:53,596
What do you mean?

404
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,098
Pan's dying.

405
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:58,467
He needs the heart of
the truest believer

406
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,270
to absorb all the magic in Neverland.

407
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:03,873
And once he does...

408
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:06,708
he will be immortal, all powerful.

409
00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:09,979
And what happens to Henry?

410
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:14,383
Well, it's a trade.

411
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:15,917
When Pan lives,

412
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:19,220
Henry will die.

413
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:57,124
Ah, it's been a long time since
I stepped foot on this shore.

414
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,533
What's that?

415
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:09,903
It's a protection spell.

416
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:12,339
Now let's go.

417
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:13,706
It's time.

418
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,330
How do we stop Pan?

419
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:31,777
Pan took Henry to Skull Rock.
But you haven't got much time.

420
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:34,064
Then we stay behind.

421
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:35,666
Someone needs to be here
to guard the lost boys

422
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,034
when they wake up.

423
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:38,669
- You don't need to stay behind.
- David's right.

424
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:41,643
You get him home, tell him we love him.

425
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:42,816
Tell him yourself,

426
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,052
when you get back from Deadman's Peak.

427
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,853
Gold can cure you back in Storybrooke.

428
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:48,955
We just need to bring
some of the water with us.

429
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:55,595
And you... you didn't give up.

430
00:21:58,098 --> 00:21:59,265
Thank you.

431
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:00,700
Well, apparently, that's the only thanks

432
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:02,634
I need these days.

433
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,103
Tink and I will
take care of things here.

434
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:05,271
Meet you back at the "Jolly Roger"

435
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:06,405
when you find Henry.

436
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,673
Promise me if your father and I

437
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:09,041
don't make it back, you get him home.

438
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,943
We're all going back home.

439
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:12,893
Together.

440
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:28,360
I'm tired.

441
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:30,295
We're almost there.

442
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:32,564
We can rest all we want
after we get the pixie dust,

443
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,999
do whatever your heart desires.

444
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,368
Just wait. You'll see.

445
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:38,003
What does it look like?

446
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:41,172
Oh. It's just like dust.

447
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:42,440
You never know the power it contains

448
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:43,775
just by looking at it.

449
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,130
But when you believe in its power,

450
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:46,444
it glows with magic

451
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:48,746
and becomes something
very special indeed.

452
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:55,686
We're here.

453
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:58,222
All I see are trees.

454
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,257
That's because it's made
in the flowers that grow

455
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,692
on the highest of the branches.

456
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,728
Where they're closest to the stars.

457
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:06,497
The flowers bloom at night,
soak in the starlight.

458
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:09,900
That's how the pixie dust gets its magic.

459
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,336
I haven't felt this excited in years,

460
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,371
since I was a boy about to climb

461
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:16,106
one of those trees in my dreams.

462
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:22,612
Come on, Rumple. It'll be fun.

463
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,415
Hey...

464
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:28,051
you wanna fly, you can't be
afraid of heights.

465
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:30,887
But I <i>don't</i> want to fly. <i>You</i> do.

466
00:23:30,922 --> 00:23:32,989
But you will, son,

467
00:23:33,023 --> 00:23:35,559
once you see how it feels.

468
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:40,530
The wind whipping in your hair,
the world below you.

469
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:42,765
Like you've not got a care in the world.

470
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,767
You're all alone.

471
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:48,404
You're free.

472
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:51,407
Come on, I'll give you a boost.

473
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:52,976
But what if I fall?

474
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,710
I promise you won't, hey.

475
00:23:54,744 --> 00:23:56,312
Don't make me, papa.

476
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,513
Please.

477
00:23:57,547 --> 00:23:59,448
I'm scared.

478
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:03,452
I'm sorry, Rumple.

479
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:05,220
I just get excited.

480
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:07,222
Why don't you wait here,
and I'll go get the pixie dust

481
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:08,824
for the both of us, hmm?

482
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:14,963
You promise not to be long?

483
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:16,764
Aye.

484
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,268
I'll be as quick as a whip.
Back before you know it.

485
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:21,903
And then you'll see how wonderful

486
00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:24,306
Neverland can really be.

487
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:10,851
I want to fly.

488
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,997
Hello?

489
00:25:25,032 --> 00:25:26,332
Is someone there?

490
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,441
Who are you?

491
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:37,877
<i>I am the sole</i>
<i>inhabitant of Neverland.</i>

492
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,413
Then can you tell me what's wrong?

493
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:43,282
Why can't I fly?

494
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:45,250
<i>You have to believe.</i>

495
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:47,486
I'm trying, but it doesn't work.

496
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,922
<i>Because you don't belong.</i>

497
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:57,362
Papa?

498
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:01,233
Papa?

499
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:03,469
Papa!

500
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:24,022
These are Henry's shoes.

501
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,660
Wendy was right. They're here.

502
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:32,029
Are you okay?

503
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:33,464
I think so.

504
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:36,033
What was that?

505
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:37,668
Pan cast a protection spell.

506
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:39,170
There has to be a way to break it.

507
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:44,041
Whoa!

508
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:45,609
Careful with that!

509
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:48,411
Try all you want,
but Pan's magic is too powerful.

510
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:49,546
At least for you.

511
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:54,785
Wha...

512
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:56,419
How did you do that?

513
00:26:56,454 --> 00:26:57,921
The spell is designed to keep anyone

514
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:59,722
who casts a shadow from entering.

515
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:01,158
And you don't have one.

516
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:03,826
You were telling the truth
about ripping your shadow off.

517
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:06,129
And Pan knows it.

518
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:08,097
That's why he cast the spell he did.

519
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:10,400
This isn't about keeping you out.

520
00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:12,135
It's about drawing me in.

521
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,703
He knows I won't give up
the chance to finish

522
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:15,305
what I came here to do.

523
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:17,006
You really did come here to save Henry.

524
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:20,143
I gave you my trust with that box.

525
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:21,778
Now I need you to give it back.

526
00:27:26,684 --> 00:27:28,785
Hey!

527
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:33,222
You better come through, Gold.

528
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:35,391
Or I'll make whatever Pan
has planned for you

529
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:38,194
look like child's play.

530
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:41,096
You understand me?

531
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,266
Well, a simple "good luck"
would've sufficed.

532
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:05,709
So what are we supposed to do now?

533
00:28:05,743 --> 00:28:07,410
What about the spell my father used

534
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:08,645
to rip off his shadow?

535
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,547
You think if I knew how to do that,

536
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,349
I wouldn't have done it already?

537
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:15,017
The moon.

538
00:28:15,052 --> 00:28:17,787
The moon?

539
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,323
The moon is what causes
our shadows, right?

540
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:23,559
What if there was a way
to block it out using magic?

541
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:24,693
What, you mean like an eclipse?

542
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:25,828
Is that even possible?

543
00:28:25,863 --> 00:28:27,363
- Maybe.
- So?

544
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:31,000
- I need help.
- With magic?

545
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:33,369
It requires a lot.

546
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:34,536
I guess we're about to find out

547
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:36,338
how much those lessons
I gave you paid off.

548
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:40,542
Follow my lead.

549
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,702
This is it.

550
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:09,704
The place where you're
going to save magic.

551
00:29:09,738 --> 00:29:11,472
Why does it have to be here?

552
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:12,873
Well, because this is the location

553
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:15,576
from which Neverland's magic emanates.

554
00:29:17,546 --> 00:29:20,147
What's the hourglass for?

555
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:21,882
Marks how much time we have left

556
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,618
before Neverland's magic runs out.

557
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:25,019
It's almost empty.

558
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:30,424
Is something wrong?

559
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,860
No.

560
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:34,094
Come with me.

561
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:40,835
There's something I need to take care of

562
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:43,403
before we get started, okay?

563
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:10,529
What's wrong?

564
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:12,498
Rumple?

565
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:15,301
Papa!

566
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:18,136
I thought something terrible
had happened to you.

567
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:21,540
No. No, I'm fine, son.

568
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:24,142
You don't have to worry about me.

569
00:30:28,482 --> 00:30:31,884
Did you get pixie dust?

570
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:33,151
Yes.

571
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,988
But when I tried using it,
it didn't work.

572
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:37,589
Why not?

573
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:40,392
I'm not a boy anymore.

574
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:41,693
You were right.

575
00:30:41,727 --> 00:30:44,263
Neverland is just for children.

576
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:45,797
Adults don't belong here.

577
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:48,300
Then...

578
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:50,002
we'll leave and go somewhere else.

579
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:52,203
All that matters...

580
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:55,740
is that we're together.

581
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:58,342
I wish it was that easy.

582
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:02,614
But we both know wherever we go,

583
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:05,383
I'll go back to my old ways.

584
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:10,054
I can never be the father
you need me to be.

585
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:11,488
I'm too weak.

586
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:15,459
I don't understand.

587
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:19,196
What are you trying to say?

588
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:20,965
That there is a way
that I can stay here,

589
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:23,667
a way that I can get
the pixie dust to work

590
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:25,035
so I can fly again...

591
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,971
just like I was when I was a boy.

592
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:29,239
How?

593
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:33,477
By letting go of the thing
that is holding me back...

594
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:35,546
you.

595
00:31:37,281 --> 00:31:38,715
Help!

596
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,650
A monster!

597
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:42,652
It's not a monster, Rumple.

598
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:43,753
It's a friend.

599
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:45,322
It's part of the island.

600
00:31:45,356 --> 00:31:47,723
And after I do what it told me...
I let you go...

601
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:49,492
it will become part of me, too.

602
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,461
Don't let him take me!

603
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,795
I don't have a choice.

604
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,131
To stay here, I have to believe
that I'm young again.

605
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,333
And with you here to remind me, I can't.

606
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,836
No, papa, please! Help me!

607
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,871
A child can't have a child, Rumple!

608
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:03,473
I'm sorry but it's true.

609
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:06,342
Don't fight it.

610
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:10,346
We both know that
you're better off without me.

611
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,816
I was never meant to be a father.

612
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,018
No!

613
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,851
Hello, laddie.

614
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,953
Oh, I see you've come bearing gifts.

615
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:56,724
Where's Henry?

616
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:59,727
Oh, you mean my great-grandson?

617
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:01,929
You still haven't told
the others who I really am?

618
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:05,699
Not even your own son.

619
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,801
Why?

620
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:09,503
Because you're nothing
but a coward to me.

621
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:11,304
We both know if that were true,

622
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:12,840
I'd already be in that box.

623
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:16,376
You don't think I can do it?

624
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,212
You let me inside just to, uh, taunt me?

625
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,014
No.

626
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:23,050
To see you again,

627
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,318
to give you one last chance.

628
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:28,688
Stay with me.

629
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:31,925
Let this go.

630
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,326
Let's start over.

631
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:38,464
Do you think I want to be with you?

632
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:42,401
That I could ever forgive you
after you abandoned me?

633
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:44,370
I'm disappointed, Rumple.

634
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:47,406
After all these years,
I thought you'd be more...

635
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:49,842
understanding,

636
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:53,912
considering <i>you</i> did
the same thing to your son.

637
00:33:53,947 --> 00:33:57,483
You traded Baelfire
for the power of a dagger,

638
00:33:57,517 --> 00:34:00,619
and I traded you for youth.

639
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:02,588
We're a lot more alike
than you care to admit.

640
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:04,323
We are <i>nothing</i> alike.

641
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:06,225
Oh, of course we are.

642
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:08,860
And it's nothing to be ashamed of.

643
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:11,563
Neither one of us was cut out
to be a father, m'boy.

644
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:15,734
I regretted leaving my son
the moment I let him go.

645
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,003
I spent my life trying to find him,

646
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:20,138
to get him back.

647
00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:21,439
And what did you do?

648
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:23,508
You forgot about me.

649
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:26,010
I never forgot about you!

650
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:28,679
Why do you think I call myself
"Peter Pan"?

651
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:31,048
Don't think for a moment
I believe it's because

652
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,517
you care for me.

653
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:35,120
But I do.

654
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:39,957
All you have to do is put down that box,

655
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:42,359
and you'll see it's true.

656
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:45,997
We can make the fresh start
you always wanted,

657
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:48,933
together,

658
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,935
just as we planned.

659
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:56,941
Oh, I'm gonna make a fresh start.

660
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:00,710
Just not with you.

661
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,424
I don't understand.

662
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,192
'Cause you don't have it.

663
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,263
You switched them?

664
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:22,731
Follow the lady.

665
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:24,733
Still having trouble believing.

666
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:26,401
In Neverland, all you have to do

667
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:29,404
is think of something to have it.

668
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:30,639
Even something fake.

669
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:33,208
But the real one...

670
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:37,112
Well, let's see what it can do.

671
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:40,415
No!

672
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:43,785
I'm sorry, Rumple.

673
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:46,488
You had your chance.

674
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:49,658
The choice was yours.

675
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:14,068
Oh.

676
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:18,638
Come on.

677
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:24,544
What happened to the bean?

678
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:27,080
He used it.

679
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:29,416
He left me and he's never coming back.

680
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,852
Oh, it's for the best, Rumple.

681
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:34,354
I'm alone now.

682
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:35,788
No, you have us...

683
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:37,590
- And a wheel.
- You always have a home here.

684
00:36:37,624 --> 00:36:39,425
Now get some rest...

685
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:40,860
And you'll feel better.

686
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:43,963
Later we'll spin, hmm?
Where's your doll?

687
00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:45,531
I lost him.

688
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:48,868
Oh. Well, we'll make you another one.

689
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:50,669
You can give it the same name.

690
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:52,371
No.

691
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:55,641
Peter Pan is gone forever.

692
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:28,873
What is this place?

693
00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:30,508
I don't remember
seeing it from my dreams.

694
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:33,210
<i>That's because it didn't exist.</i>

695
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:37,548
<i>It was created when you made</i>
<i>the decision to stay here.</i>

696
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:39,083
A giant skull?

697
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:40,784
It's glorious!

698
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:43,787
What's the hourglass for?

699
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:45,656
<i>It represents the magic</i>
<i>fueling your youth,</i>

700
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,426
<i>the magic allowing you to stay here,</i>

701
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,094
<i>to stay young.</i>

702
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:51,862
And what happens when it runs out?

703
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:54,832
<i>Your youth will be taken</i>

704
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:57,000
<i>and you will die.</i>

705
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:59,102
But I thought I was going
to stay young forever.

706
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:00,370
<i>Neverland is a place</i>

707
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,772
<i>for children to visit in their dreams,</i>

708
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:04,207
<i>not a place for them to live.</i>

709
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,343
<i>You are the first to try to stay.</i>

710
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:09,679
<i>And in doing so,</i>
<i>you're breaking the rules.</i>

711
00:38:09,713 --> 00:38:13,583
Any rule can be broken, especially here.

712
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:17,753
I made this place
without even thinking about it.

713
00:38:17,788 --> 00:38:18,955
There has to be a way.

714
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,690
<i>Perhaps.</i>

715
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:22,258
Then I will find it.

716
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:24,527
I will find a way.

717
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:27,129
I believe.

718
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:39,074
It's time, Henry.

719
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,177
Time to save magic,

720
00:38:42,212 --> 00:38:43,845
to save Neverland.

721
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,347
What do I have to do?

722
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:47,582
You must give me your heart, Henry...

723
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:51,053
the heart of the truest believer.

724
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:52,054
You mean...

725
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:53,722
I have to believe.

726
00:38:53,756 --> 00:38:56,225
No, Henry.

727
00:38:56,259 --> 00:39:01,362
I mean, you need to give me your heart.

728
00:39:01,397 --> 00:39:03,899
But... what will happen to me?

729
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:06,601
You'll become
the greatest of all heroes.

730
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:10,471
You can tell me the truth.

731
00:39:10,506 --> 00:39:13,107
I know all magic comes with a price.

732
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,576
Saving it must come with a price, too.

733
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,545
I would never lie to you, Henry.

734
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:18,913
I mean, you're right.

735
00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:20,981
There is a price.

736
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:30,324
You have to stay here
on the island with me.

737
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,293
Neverland will become your new home.

738
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:36,163
I know it's a huge sacrifice,
but isn't it worth it?

739
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:40,668
Heroes have to make sacrifices
all the time.

740
00:39:40,702 --> 00:39:42,169
My family taught me that.

741
00:39:42,203 --> 00:39:44,805
Then they'd be proud
if they could see you now,

742
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,007
because you're about to save them all.

743
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:50,944
Now are you ready?

744
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:52,079
Yes.

745
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:55,648
Then let me help you.

746
00:40:11,131 --> 00:40:12,565
Henry, wait!

747
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,467
Whatever Pan's telling you
to do, don't do it.

748
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:16,502
Dad? You're alive?

749
00:40:16,536 --> 00:40:17,737
I am, buddy.

750
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:19,238
And I need you to listen to me.

751
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:21,240
Pan is lying to you.

752
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:23,275
Oh, pleasure to see you, too, Baelfire,

753
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,178
not to mention the Savior

754
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:28,747
and the Evil Queen.

755
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:29,948
Henry,

756
00:40:29,983 --> 00:40:31,584
you need to get away from him now.

757
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:32,918
- He's trying to hurt you.
- No.

758
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,953
The heart of the truest believer.

759
00:40:34,988 --> 00:40:36,888
It's what's gonna save magic.

760
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:38,724
It's gonna save all of you.

761
00:40:38,758 --> 00:40:41,426
No, it's not.

762
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,329
This was never about magic, Henry.

763
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:46,098
You have to believe us.

764
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:49,534
The only person Pan's interested
in saving is himself.

765
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:50,636
That's not true!

766
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,004
Of course it isn't.

767
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:53,471
Yes, it is!

768
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:55,440
Pan can't live without you dying.

769
00:40:55,474 --> 00:40:57,175
If you give him your heart,
it's gonna kill you.

770
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:59,210
They're trying
to stem your belief, Henry.

771
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:01,646
But don't let them.

772
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,516
Remember, every hero gets tested.

773
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:11,488
Henry...

774
00:41:11,523 --> 00:41:13,724
I know what being a hero looks like,

775
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:15,726
and this isn't it.

776
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:16,894
Why would they lie?

777
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:21,098
Because that's what adults do, Henry.

778
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,068
You know that better than anyone.

779
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:25,903
Henry...

780
00:41:25,937 --> 00:41:27,771
you have to believe us.

781
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,373
Your parents don't care
about Neverland, Henry.

782
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:31,608
They know if you give
your heart to save it,

783
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:33,510
then you'll have to stay.

784
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:37,013
They're being selfish because
they don't wanna lose you.

785
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:38,748
Henry, you have to trust us.

786
00:41:38,783 --> 00:41:40,784
Trust?

787
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:41,985
I'm the only one

788
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:43,119
who's ever been honest with you, Henry.

789
00:41:43,154 --> 00:41:47,390
The only one who ever believed in you.

790
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:50,927
This is <i>your</i> choice. Not theirs.

791
00:41:52,496 --> 00:41:54,698
You have to choose now.

792
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:56,966
We're running out of time.

793
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:58,267
We believe in you, Henry.

794
00:41:58,302 --> 00:42:01,404
Because we love you.

795
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:02,738
More than anything.

796
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:05,441
I love you, too.

797
00:42:07,877 --> 00:42:09,278
But I have to save magic.

798
00:42:09,313 --> 00:42:11,314
No, no, no, no! I'm sorry.

799
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:13,649
No!

800
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:39,240
Henry!
